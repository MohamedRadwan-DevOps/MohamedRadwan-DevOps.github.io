First this feature included in the Windows 2008 R2 SP1 We have to
install integration service for each VM on the Hyper-V after we install
Win 2008 R2 SP1, just click any machine on action menu and choose insert
integration disk setup, and start setup it, if you install the old
integration service you will prompt with upgrade from old integration
service to the new one After that you can use dynamic memory in the
Hyper-v settings for each VM give the start up the minimum and the max
the maximum review the memory demand that appear now in the hyper-v
console administration enjoy :-) For more information see the following
