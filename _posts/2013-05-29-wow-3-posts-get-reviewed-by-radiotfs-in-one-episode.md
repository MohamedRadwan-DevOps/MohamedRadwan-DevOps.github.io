I should have written this post a while ago, but as you may already know, I was on a business trip and just came back. I am excited to share that three of my posts were reviewed and mentioned by [RadioTFS](http://www.radiotfs.com/Show/53/NewYearNewShow "53 New Year New Show")!

So, what does this mean? It means a lot to me. The people who inspired me and continuously impress me have reviewed my blog posts and given positive feedback. WOW! I really love that. Reviews from the community are the best way to keep contributors motivated and encouraged to continue contributing. So, THANK YOU GUYS!

Thanks to [Martin Woodward](http://www.woodwardweb.com/about.html "Martin Woodward"), [Mickey Gousset](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/speakers/Mickey-Gousset "Mickey Gousset"), [Paul Hacker](http://phacker.wordpress.com/ "Paul Hacker"), and [Greg Duncan](http://coolthingoftheday.blogspot.com/ "Greg Duncan"). You have always helped and inspired me a lot, guys!
