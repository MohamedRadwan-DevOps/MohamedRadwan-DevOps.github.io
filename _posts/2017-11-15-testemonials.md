I had the pleasure of having Mohamed for almost three years in Testhouse, collaborating on several DevOps projects for various clients. Mohamed's ability to deliver the project was extremely good and made a dramatic increase in the productivity level of our company. No matter how tense a project, Mohamed made sure it met the client expectation. All our clients like his work and he always get impressive feedback from them.

I had the pleasure of having Mohamed in my staff as a senior ALM Consultant. Mohamed is the kind of guy who either already can solve things or if he don't know how to, he will pursue the knowledge, so he is able to. It was a real pleasure working with Mohamed and I hope to be able to do so again in the future.

While contracting through Testhouse in 2018 I worked with two separate companies that wanted to improve their Agile development and testing processes. Both companies were looking for help with their procedures and their use of tools. Mohamed was the lead on the tools side and I had the pleasure of working along side him on both projects. He had an excellent understanding of the Microsoft tools including VSTS and DevOps but his real strength was to understand each of the clients key requirements and deliver solutions that fitted in with the way they wanted to work. He has very good analysis skills, is good at building relationships with team members and is also a good listener. This made the change programmes work more smoothly and we were able to deliver improved processes that were supported by an effective implementation of the tools required. I can highly recommend Mohamed.

Radwan is a great engineer, leader and mentor. I used to see him working for long hours every night to do more researches about different software engineering topics just to improve the software development process and practices used at our company. Just give Radwan a challenge and keep watching how he will dedicate all his time and thinking to it, and Radwan will definitely exceed your expectations. It was really a rich educating experience to just work and have many technical chats with Radwan. I always believed that he has the skills to be one of the well known and effective software development gurus in the world, not just in the region.
