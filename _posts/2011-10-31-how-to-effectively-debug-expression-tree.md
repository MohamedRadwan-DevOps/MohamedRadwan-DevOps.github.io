First this is a very small tip and the reason for creating it because it
took me time to reach where I can click the button to display the
visualizer of the Expression tree?

-   First we have to be in the debug mode

<!-- -->

-   Second open add-watch window for the expression

[![ExpressionTree](/assets/img/2011/10/ExpressionTree-1024x530.png)](/assets/img/2011/10/ExpressionTree.png)

-   Third click on the a magnifying glass that appears, that\'s it

-   Variable names are displayed with a \"\$\" symbol at the beginning.
-   Assigned an automatically generated names for parameters, such as
    \$var1 or \$var2.
-   Assigned an automatically generated name for lambda expression, such
    as #Lambda1 or #Lambda2.
