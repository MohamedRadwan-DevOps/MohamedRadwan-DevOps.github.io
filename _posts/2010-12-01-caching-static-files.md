I will show how to configure IIS 7 to enable caching of scripts, CSSÂ  and all other static files that will not change everyday Select th folder that you want to enable caching and double click HTTP header

![HTTPResponseHeader](/assets/images/2010/12/HTTPResponseHeader.png)

![Enable Caching](/assets/images/2010/12/SetExpireDate.png)

That\'s it And remember if you are still in the debuting time and you want to clear the cache just press ctr+f5 while you browse to clear the cache.
