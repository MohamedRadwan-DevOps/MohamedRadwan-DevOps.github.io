## A quick guide about Agile Software Testing

This guide presents the basic idea behind Agile methodology and its connection to software testing. It describes the structural idea of Agile and explains the importance of adaptation to the changes in the fast-paced software development world.

>You can find more information about **DevOps** in the following post: [DevOps: The Three Stage Conversation - People, Process, Products](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io/posts/devops-the-three-stage-conversation-people-process-products/) which describes the basic principles of **DevOps**. This post will be especially helpful to those for whom DevOps is still a new concept. If you prefer a deeper view on this topic, have a look at the following guide: [quick guide about Basic Principles of DevOps](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io/posts/published-a-quick-guide-about-basic-principles-of-devops/), which presents an overview of the [DevOps](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/devops/) process and practices, describing "the big picture", while still maintaining a high level of detail.

>In order to ensure [**Continuous Integration**](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/continuous-integration/), we need to use a proper **deploying strategy**. Read more about deploying with Feature Branches and Feature Toggle in the following post: [Deploy from Branches with and without Feature Toggle](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io/posts/promoting-your-application-deployment-to-different-environments-from-branches-with-and-without-feature-toggle/).

>You can see this video, if you would like to find more information about how to get started with Release Management and its advantages. See how to create a build definition using CI/CD Tools for VSTS Extensions. (I will be using Package Extension and Publish Artifact tasks), and also using DevOps-VSTS-POC trigger in order to enable CI. All of that in order to be able to publish, share, install and query versions. You will see how to create a release definition, choose an artifact, and configure source for the artifact and default version. See how to create different environments or clone the existing one. In my case, I am going to create QA, Preproduction, and Production environments, each with one phase and one task. See also how to configure the Publish Extension task for each environment. See an end-to-end continuous delivery pipeline using VSTS extension with Build and Release Management.
