I create a video on YouTube that describe my approach for
customizing the TFS Process template 2010, the main point of the
custimization are the following points:

1.  Create prohibited groups
2.  Assign prohibited groups permission for Lab, Build, Source
3.  Create fields
4.  Customize and create new work items using the old and the new fields
5.  Assign prohibited groups to work items changing states

You can also see [Microsoft guidance for customizing the process](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2010/08/13/customizing-tfs-2010-process-guidance.aspx?ocid=soc-n-eg-elite--MRadwan)
