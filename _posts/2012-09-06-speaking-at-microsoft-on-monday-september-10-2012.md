Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 is a powerful application development environment that ensures quality code throughout the entire Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), which is a proven set of tools and processes that helps organizations manage the entire lifespan of application development, reduce cycle times, and eliminate waste. ALM integrates different teams, platforms, and activities, enabling a continuous flow of business value. In this session, we will introduce the major new features and improvements in Visual Studio 2012.
