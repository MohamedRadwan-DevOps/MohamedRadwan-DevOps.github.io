In a previous post I introduced our [TFSEG (TFS Egypt User Group) Principles](https://mohamedradwan.com/posts/getting-religion-with-tfs-for-agile-software-development/ " TFSEG Values and Principles"),
I mention how these Principles are interconnected with each other and
how they are considered as one unit and breaking one could break all of
them. Today I will talk about the following Principle: \"[**Get the
fastest hardware you have ever had**]

[![](/assets/images/2012/08/fast-hardware.jpg?w=300 "Fast Hardware")](/assets/images/2012/08/fast-hardware.jpg)

I can spend all the day talk about this principle but I will be
summarized as much as I can,  if you want to understand some of
my believes and why this is very very important, just think of the
following: Consider that your work is distance **50 KM** from your home
and you just have a bike , so how much time daily you spend  in going
and coming back from your work????? According to most of  [bike
riders](http://www.bikeforums.net/archive/index.php/t-747012.html "100km for average ")
this distance ( **50 KM \* 2**) **100 KM** will take about **5 hours**,
so you will spend 5 hours daily in your way for going and coming back
from you work, if you working 5 days per week that\'s mean you spend 25
hours per week, 100 hours per month, 1200 hours per year.  **Bike**

**5** hours/ Day **25** hours/ Week **100** hours/ Month **1200** hours/
Year  Just imagine that you buy a car, but you don\'t have money to buy
a car, than you need to priorities your life needs and consider the car
is more important than your shoes and your eat, so if you could buy a
car you can achieve the following.  **Car**

**1** hours/ Day **5** hours/ Week **20 **hours/ Month **240 **hours/
Year


## So you saved about **960 Hours** if you work these hours you could buy three cars not only one!!!!

 In our approach we have to verify our application integrity all the
time so this drives us to have a lot of automation in build, deployment,
 installation, configuration, unit tests and many others, so just
consider running a build that has **4000 unit test**, how much time do
you think this build will take? How much time it will take to:

-   Take a snapshot?
-   Restore a snapshot?
-   Create a backup?
-   Restore a backup?
-   Running parallel  build 3 or 4 or 5\.... together?
-   How many build each developer perform daily?
-   What about
    [**(CI) Continuous Integration**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration "Continuous integration")?
-   Deploy a build to a QA server?
-   Deploy a build to a Staging server?
-   Many others

So **Save your time and being fast as you can,
let\'s the problem be your real problem not a hardware
problem.**  So This is the new machine I got it now !!!!,
