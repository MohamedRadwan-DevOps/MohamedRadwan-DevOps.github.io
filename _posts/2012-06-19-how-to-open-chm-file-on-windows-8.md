I
was stacked in how to open chm file on [Windows 8](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview) ,
I read many posts about some registery option and disable
[UAC](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2007/03/23/how-to-cut-down-on-user-account-control-prompting.aspx?ocid=soc-n-eg-elite--MRadwan) 
but nothing work :-( So I start search for
[winhelp](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/08/17/10050774.aspx?ocid=soc-n-eg-elite--MRadwan) 
for [Windows 8](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview) ,
but I couldn\'t found it too :-( This maybe because I am working on
Windows 8 CP and the other HDD has Windows 8 RP but it\'s not stable on
my Laptop [(Dell XPS)](http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/xps-laptops?c=us&l=en&cs=19) 
specially with touch screen driver that still a beta with some error of
course, so the following solution is just a temp for now, by the way if
you want to have a look on Windows 8 on touch screen, [see the this
post](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io/posts/install-windows-8-release-preview-and-have-a-look-on-touch-screen/) 
So finally I search for
[Ubuntu ](http://www.ubuntu.com/) chm file so I found
this wonderful application that makes me able to view chm file :-) xCHM
[Download it form here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xchm/files/xCHM%20for%20Win32/xchm-1.19/xchm-1.19win32.zip/download "xCHM")
