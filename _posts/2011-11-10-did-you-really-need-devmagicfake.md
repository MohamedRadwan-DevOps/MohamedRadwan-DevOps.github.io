Till now I didn\'t get the feedback that I expected from publishing my project DevMagicFake
on [Code](http://devmagicfake.codeplex.com/ "DevMagicFake")[Plex](http://devmagicfake.codeplex.com/ "DevMagicFake"),

I believe that DevMagicFake will really make different change of
the programming life style, quality and productivity for software
development. But to do this, it just need to be understood very well
first, because most of the people who give me feedback didn\'t get the
whole point of DevMagicFake. I will keep explaining why and why you will
really need to use DevMagicFake, let\'s see the following scenario:
Suppose we are working on a feature that require our system to have 1000
products, 100 customers and each customer has made 50 orders and each
order has 20 line items and each line of item should belong to one
product of the 1000 products. WOW to **Design**, **Develop** and
**Test** this feature we will need to develop the feature and use the
completed UI features to enter all these data (**if the UI is
complete?**) and even if the UI is complete this will take too much
time specially I always change object model and data structure of my
classes or my DB, I can\'t even make any automation to enter the data
through the UI, this because also the changing that always happen :-(
Even if we have DB and we start generate data, the generated data will
not belong to each other and will not give us the consistence data that
we really want to work on
our feature to **Design**, **Development **and **Test it**. Just think
how many times we change the structure of the objects and the DB???  So
how we can do this in no time???? DevMagicFake can do this with
one line of code, so we can start working and testing and make a real
good design for our feature as we already enter all these data even with
any change happen every time Think of

-   Develop by feature
-   Test Driven Development
-   Test Driven Design
-   I didn\'t complete the whole database
-   I always change my object model and always need to be existing data
    related to each other with the new modification of the object model
    classes I have made

What is the solution?????? DevMagicFake will help us do this with no
effort at all. 

Thanks
