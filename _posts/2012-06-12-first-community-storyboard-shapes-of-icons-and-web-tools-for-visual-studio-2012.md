I am really happy to be the first one from the community to contribute
to the Visual
Studio [Storyboard shapes](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?f%5B0%5D.Type=RootCategory&f%5B0%5D.Value=StoryboardShapes "Storyboard Shapes") and
galleries for [Storyboarding Backlog
Items](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tfs/hh301773(v=vs.110).aspx "Storyboarding Backlog Items").
I am really inspired by the Storyboard and I believe it will become the
first-class citizen for product owners, analysts, and web designers. For
those who don't know the
[storyboarding](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tfs/hh301773(v=vs.110).aspx "storyboarding"),
it is a new feature in [Visual Studio
2012](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us "Visual Studio 2012")
that will improve User Stories and Requirements with
PowerPoint through creating a prototype and UI animation using
PowerPoint with a Visual Studio add-in. You can also use another
new feature which is the [Microsoft Stakeholder Feedback
Client](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh301769(v=vs.110).aspx "Stakeholder Feedback Client").

**First library, Font Awesome Icons**

[![](/assets/img/2012/09/m-radwan-font-awesome-icons-storyboard.jpg "M.Radwan-Font-Awesome-Icons-Storyboard")](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3a761c76-0b62-4e7f-806e-31cc76251b68)

I like [Font
Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/ "Font Awesome")
so much especially
with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ "Bootstrap"),
so I decided to convert this wonderful library (Font Awesome) into
Storyboard icons. [Download Font Awesome Icons Storyboard gallery from
here](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3a761c76-0b62-4e7f-806e-31cc76251b68 "Font Awesome Storyboard gallery download").

**Second library, Web Tool**

[![](/assets/img/2012/09/m-radwan-web-tools-storyboard.png "M.Radwan-Web-Tools-Storyboard")](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a28356fd-ee91-4341-b5d1-06b0d0625330)

I have some ideas in Web that I believe we will need a lot in web
projects, like block loaders, notification bars, modal forms,
confirmation modals, and many others, so I created another gallery and
called it Web Tool. Of course, this is just the start! [Download Web Tool
Storyboard gallery from
here](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a28356fd-ee91-4341-b5d1-06b0d0625330 "Web Tool Storyboard gallery download").

I hope the [Visual Studio
2012](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us "Feedback Client") galleries start
to fill up with many libraries from the community because I believe it will
help a lot of people to produce better software :-)
