A couple of weeks ago I just sign the **DZone** agreement as a
**DZone** **MVB** (**Most Valuable Blogger**). If you shouldn\'t already
know, \"DZone is a technology publishing company that produces valuable
content for software architects and developers worldwide.\"

> The MVB program builds mutually beneficial partnerships between DZone
> and community bloggers whose articles are of interest to the developer
> community. The program simplifies the process of publishing selected
> blog articles by MVB members onto DZone\'s network of
> development-focused editorial websites. Through this process, our MVBs
> enjoy substantially increased visibility and our audience enjoys great
> content.

As a one of the community members, yes we always happy with any kind
of recognition from the community, we always happy to participate and to
be part the community that we really love\....we always love and happy
to communicate with other geeks and community members that we could
share and learn from each other \....we really was born to learn\... I
think this will encourage  me to produce more quality posts\...and more
contribution to the world :-)
