I created a small tool to permanently delete TFS Work Items from Team Foundation Server Database. I found some old tools, but they didn\'t work with [TFS 2013](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/ff637362.aspx "Team Foundation Server") and the source code was not available. So, I decided to create a new one and share the source code.

[Download the tool from Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/112a2055-4363-4a4e-a866-ea29bc6f2cbb "Download the tool from Visual Studio Gallery")

[Visit the source code on CodePlex](https://tfsdeleteworkitems.codeplex.com/ "Visit the source code on CodePlex")

**This tool physically deletes work items from a Team Foundation Server. Use it at your own risk**
