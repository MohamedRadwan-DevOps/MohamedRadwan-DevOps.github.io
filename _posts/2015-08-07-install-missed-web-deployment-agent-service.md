In addition, I am going to show how to develop a Single Page Application using HTML/CSS/JavaScript as a Front End developer. Also, learn how to download VSS-SDK JavaScript library and how to use it and its manifest file (vss-extension.json). Afterwards, how to pack the code into VSIX package using TFS command line, upload it, share and install on VSTS account. At the end, I am going to configure Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Pipeline. I will also discuss errors you may face during this process and share some notes.
