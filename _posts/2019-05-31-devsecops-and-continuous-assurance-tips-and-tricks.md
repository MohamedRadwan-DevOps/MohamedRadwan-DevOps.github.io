In DevOps, you have probably heard about CI/CD - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, but have you heard of or implemented Continuous Assurance? As we move fast with DevOps, we must not compromise security and compliance. DevSecOps, or Rugged DevOps, has become very essential and a key for DevOps implementation. It introduces security as a shift-left mindset with a lot of practices. So, as security practices moved to the beginning, it required different techniques to achieve the same goals.
