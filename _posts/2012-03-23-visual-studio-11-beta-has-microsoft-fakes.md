From long time ago I write about how we can use
[Mole](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/moles/ "Microsoft Moles")
in layer isolation, for more info see the post
[here](https://mohamedradwan.com/2011/07/21/how-to-isolate-layers-and-other-library-using-moles-in-unit-testing/ "Using Moles").
But with release of Visual Studio 11 Beta, it came with Microsoft Fakes,
which I think it based on Moles, the main benfit of  Microsoft Fakes or
Moles the ability to mock or stub the sealed classes (no public
constructors) The Fakes framework helps developers create, maintain, and
inject dummy implementations in their unit tests. The Fakes framework
generates and maintains stub types and shim types for a system under
test Fore more information see the post on
[MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh549175%28v=vs.110%29.aspx "Microsoft Fakes")
