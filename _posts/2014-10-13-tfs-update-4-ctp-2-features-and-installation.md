#### Web Access can return directly to query results from a detailed view of the query by using a context menu.

In Team Web Access, if you run a query and open a work item from the query result, you can get back to the query result from the work item context menu on the top-right.

#### Web Access can generate an email directly from the work item view by using a new toolbar command.

In the previous update 3, you could send an email from the context menu only, but now you can send an email from the work item toolbar.

#### The free Stakeholder license provides access to the project home page from which Stakeholders can view the backlog, edit items, run work item queries, and many other operations.

There is a new Access level feature for the Stakeholder that gives them more features than the limited level.
