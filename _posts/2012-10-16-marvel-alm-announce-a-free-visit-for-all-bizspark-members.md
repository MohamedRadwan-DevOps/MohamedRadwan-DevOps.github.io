I am really always proud of [Marvel ALM](http://marvelalm.com/ "Marvel ALM") in how it is part of the community and how we really care about raising the ALM and the best practices of software development in our country, region, and globe. For this reason, Marvel ALM is pleased to announce that we already announced in the first [**BizSpark Event in Egypt**](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io/posts/speaking-at-microsoft-startupbizspark-event-on-sunday-sep-30-2012/ "BizSpark Event in Egypt") a free visit for all [**BizSpark**](http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/ "Microsoft BizSpark") members that **they are really wanting to implement the ALM** in their company.

We are also very happy to help and guide them with any inquiries they may need and also guide them on how to start. If you want my advice, I see that every company that really needs the visit should start the implementation. As I mentioned in the session, we already contribute a lot of work to the community, like the [Visual Guide for TFS 2012](http://tfs2012visualguide.codeplex.com/ "The Visual Guide for Building Team Foundation Server 2012 Environments") on **CodePlex**, [MEA ALM Community](http://www.meaalmcommunity.com/ "MEA ALM Community"), and many others. So the company should start to watch and implement the tools. After that, collect all the questions and issues that they may face and ask them during the visit so they can get maximum value from the visit.

In the visit, we will make a gap analysis and guide the company with hands-on activities on how to reach the desired state. We will also guide them on how and where to search for their issues and find solutions.

For any inquiry, please contact us at [info@marvelalm.com](mailto:info@marvelalm.com "info@marvelalm.com") or visit our website at [www.marvelalm.com](http://marvelalm.com/ "Marvel ALM Website").

We are always wishing you all success. **Itâ€™s Coming... Rise of the ALM Tools...!!!**

**Marvel ALM Team**
