When creating SCVMM Environment for Lab Management 2013 over SCVMM 2012 R2, you must select at least one VHDD and mark it as '**Contains an operating system**'. This is the error if that option is not selected for the template.

![The customizable template must contain exactly one virtual disk marked as 'Contains an operating system'-3](/assets/img/2013/10/the-customizable-template-must-contain-exactly-one-virtual-disk-marked-a-s-contains-an-operating-system-31.jpg)

Set the option '**Contains an operating system**' from here.

![The customizable template must contain exactly one virtual disk marked as 'Contains an operating system'-2](/assets/img/2013/10/the-customizable-template-must-contain-exactly-one-virtual-disk-marked-a-s-contains-an-operating-system2.jpg)

Verify again to make sure it is resolved.
