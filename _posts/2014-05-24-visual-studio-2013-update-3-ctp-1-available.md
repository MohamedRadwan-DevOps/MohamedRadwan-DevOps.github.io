Microsoft released [**Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 CTP 1**](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2933779 "Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 CTP 1 download"){target="_blank"} yesterday (May 22, 2014). It's a cumulative update that includes all new features and fixes from previous updates, so there's no need to install any updates before this one. There are many areas of improvements, but I really liked what has been done so far for the **Testing Tools**.

- You can add custom fields and custom workflows for test plans and test suites.
- You can use Manage Test Suites permission for granting access to test suites.
- You can track changes to test plans and test suites by using work item history.

>This update is for Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server (TFS) and they are different. The Visual Studio update installs on top of whatever is already installed on the machine. The TFS update is a full layout that replaces whatever is installed on the machine. Before you try to apply the TFS update, make sure that you have a full backup of your current databases. If the TFS update installation fails, you cannot restart the update or roll back to the earlier version of TFS without performing a restore.
