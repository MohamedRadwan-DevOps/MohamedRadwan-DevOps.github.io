just announced 2 weeks ago about [VS/TFS 2013.2 (Update 2) CTP1](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2927432/en-us "VS/TFS 2013.2 (Update 2) CTP1"),
I really wanted to get close for the new features and enhancement so I
decide to install that update and share my experience for the
installation and the new features. There is knowing issue about that
update so it took from me sometimes to install and record my video,
remember it\'s not a **Go live support.
