### Overview of Microsoft Ignite The Tour London

In January 2020, there was an amazing conference [Microsoft Ignite The Tour in London](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/ignite-the-tour/london)

I had the pleasure to participate as an Expert at the conference and help many attendees to solve their real problem and explain what's new about Microsoft DevOps and Cloud technologies. This conference gave the opportunity to attendees to discover the latest trends and the future of Data, Cloud, IT, and Business Intelligence. This recap would be a great value for your career path. There were **182** sessions spread over two days along with a Microsoft Showcase area which contained more than **350** experts and product demonstrations. There was also 'The Hub', a place to hang out where sponsors and other third parties had stalls. So, I made this recap to help the community to solve and answer questions and issues they struggle with. Whether you are a business decision-maker or a professional individual, fresh graduate or even a student, you don't want to miss this treasure.

I also had the pleasure to have fantastic interviews with amazing speakers from Microsoft as well as industry practitioners. It was a great opportunity to have several discussions around the future of the cloud, how businesses and individuals should respond, and what we expect next. We discussed the current job trends in the market, what the job demands for several IT areas either now or in the future. We also discussed some tips and tricks for how to keep up with the fast pace of change in the industry either as business or individual. We also talked about some advice for students and fresh graduates who are very interested to join big companies, what they should do and what is the roadmap to get well prepared. Also, we talked about some interview tips and tricks for a successful interview. Finally, we spoke about some advice for achieving high performance in a company.
