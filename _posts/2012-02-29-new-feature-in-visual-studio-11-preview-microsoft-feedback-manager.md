Now, there is a very powerful tool called Microsoft Feedback Manager
released with [MTM 11 Preview](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io/category/tfs-11-beta/ "TFS 11 Beta"),
this feature enable customer or product owner or what ever
anyone interested to give feedback on the product or on the implemented
user stories This feature like the MTM, it will record the session that
run and can get feedback with the result to the team so they
can consider this feedback in the project, really it is a very nice
feature and it will help to increase the product quality, till now it\'s
part of the Visual Studio 11 Preview but I think it will be separated
for licence wise

-   The story begin with email sent to the person that need his/her
    feedback with, instructions to install the tool and any needed
    software (like Expression Encoder 4 which will be needed for video
    recording), and link to the product that being need the feedback, it
    will include also the user name and the password for log in if
    needed
-   The feedbacker will open Microsoft Feedback Manager and open the
    link of the product that has the new user stories
-   He/she will start to try the user stories and this will
    be recorded (video, audio, screen capture and actions)
-   He/she will write the comments that he/she want
-   Submit the feedback to TFS
-   Browse for old submitted feedback

So let\'s see the steps Open Microsoft Feedback Manager 11 Preview
