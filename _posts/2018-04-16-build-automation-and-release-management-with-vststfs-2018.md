Learn how to get started with Release Management and its advantages. See
how to create a build definition using CI/CD Tools for VSTS Extensions.
(I will be using Package Extension and Publish Artifact tasks). And also
using DevOps-VSTS-POC trigger in order to enable CI. All of that in
order to be able to publish, share, install and query versions. You will
see how to create release definition, choose an artifact and configure
source for the artifact and default version. See how to create different
environments or clone the existing one, in my case I am going to create
QA. Preproduction and Production environment, each with one phrase and
one task. See also how to configure Publish Extension task for each
environment ! See an end-to-end continuous delivery pipeline using VSTS
extension with Build and Release Management. 

>You can find more information about **DevOps** in the
following post: [DevOps: The Three Stage Conversation - People, Process,
Products](https://mohamedradwan.com/posts/devops-the-three-stage-conversation-people-process-products/)
which describes the basic principles of **DevOps**. This post will be
especially helpful to those for whom DevOps is still a new concept. If
you prefer a deeper view on this topic, have a look at the following
guide: [quick guide about Basic Principles of
DevOps](https://mohamedradwan.com/posts/published-a-quick-guide-about-basic-principles-of-devops/),
which presents an overview of
[DevOps](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/devops/) process and practices,
describing \"the big picture\", while still maintaining the high level
of detail.

The post describes how Azure deployments are made easy by using Visual
Studio Team Services (VSTS) Release Management. You will see a
step-by-step tutorial on how to configure and deploy to Azure in Release
Management, and, moreover, how to configure an end-to-end pipeline for
