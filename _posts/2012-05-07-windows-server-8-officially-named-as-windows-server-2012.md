On April 17, Microsoft officials said during the opening keynote of the
Microsoft Management Summit (MMS) 2012 that the final name of Windows
Server 8 will be \"Windows Server 2012.\" I believe that, this year we
have a lot of programs that will release by Microsoft that I think it
will cover the rest of the current decade, so brace yourself! Windows
server 2012 start screen, it\'s really awesome!
