Most of people around me think that I am a person that is very sharp and
not flexible at all, but actually this is not true, I believe in
flexibility and exception but I also believe that the flexibility and
the exception should be a few and minimize as possible but not become
the main scenario !!

And there are many good words like the Gandhi word "[ be the change you wish to see in the world] \" So this
why I do what I do, I just try change the world by becoming the change that I want, we fed up from the whole mess that we see in the world, we can\'t let exception become the main scenario, and this not means that we are not flexible, this mean thatwe want the flexibility and exception to be limited as it suppose to be.
