Join our latest Hero sessions.

Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 is a powerful application development environment that ensures quality code throughout the entire Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) which is a proven set of tools and processes that helps organizations manage the entire lifespan of application development, reduce cycle times, and eliminate waste. ALM integrates different teams, platforms, and activities, enabling a continuous flow of business value.

In this session we will introduce Build Automation using TFS 2012, SSDT SQL Server Developer Tools, the new tool for database development projects.
