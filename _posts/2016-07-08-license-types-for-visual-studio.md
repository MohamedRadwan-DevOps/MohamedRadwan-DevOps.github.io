>If your migration process only requires migrating the work items, with no need to migrate links & relations between them, you can consider using the TFS Integration Platform, which is less complicated than the VSTS Sync Migrator. For more information about this tool, visit [TFS 2017 Migration To VSTS with TFS Integration Platform](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io/posts/tfs-2017-migration-to-vsts-with-tfs-integration-platform/).

### Part 1: Visual Studio Professional licenses 

With [**Visual Studio Professional licenses**](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-professional-with-msdn-vs), you'll get access to numerous **Microsoft** products, services, support, and trainings. There are different subscription options for individual developers or teams to choose what best suits their needs. The main differences, besides the pricing, are different accesses and additional benefits.

In a **Standalone License** which you can buy from **Microsoft's store** or from **resellers**, you won't have any specific time limits and there are no additional **Subscriber Benefits**. But you will get the **Perpetual license terms**, which means when all non-software benefits expire, you will still be able to continue using some software.

For **Standard Subscription with MSDN**, you will have to commit for a specific period - 12, 24, or 36 months, but you will get the **full benefits package**, which includes tools and software such as [**Xamarin Studio**](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/xamarin-vs), [**Team Foundation Server**](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/tfs-overview-vs.aspx) license, \$50 of monthly credit for dev/test [**Microsoft Azure**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), **Windows developer account**, **Windows & SQL Server**, 30 courses of [**Pluralsight training**](https://www.pluralsight.com/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer} and much more. This subscription provides also **Perpetual license terms**.

You will get the same features in an annual **Cloud subscription** except for **Perpetual license terms**. However, for **monthly Cloud subscriptions**, you will be committed only for 1 month but will **not get any Subscriber Benefits**. For **both Cloud subscriptions**, you will need to have also **Azure subscription for billing**.
