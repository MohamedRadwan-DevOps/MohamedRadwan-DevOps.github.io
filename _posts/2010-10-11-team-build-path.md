Today when I building my project on our team build server I face the following problem "Cannot evaluate the item metadata "%(FullPath)"  the error because my path exced 260 character so be careful for not execed this value. You can look at the following link for more information [Team Build and 260+ Character Paths](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/aaronhallberg/archive/2007/06/20/team-build-and-260-character-paths.aspx?ocid=soc-n-eg-elite--MRadwan "Team Build Blog")
