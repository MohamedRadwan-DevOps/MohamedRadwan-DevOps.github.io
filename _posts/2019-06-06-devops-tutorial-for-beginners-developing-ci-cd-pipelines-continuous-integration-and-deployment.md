This video will focus on the advanced overview of DevOps. You will learn and understand in detail what DevOps means, how to measure DevOps performance, and see examples of real companies implementing high-performance DevOps. You will also learn about Continuous Integration, the benefits of having quality gates as a safeguard for your code, and Continuous Deployment. Understand the idea and the reason for having different deployment environments and how to promote your application from one environment to another. Learn the 8 principles and 4 practices of Continuous Delivery, the difference between build pipelines and release pipelines, and for which pipeline you should consider your task to run.

Let's see some points which will be covered in this video:

**50% of the Fortune 500 is gone!** So, for those who don't know about the Fortune 500, it is a magazine in the US that lists the top 500 companies based on the fiscal year revenue. So, 50% of these companies have disappeared, being replaced by other companies that used technology to deliver customer value faster, better, and cheaper. If anyone remembers or knows the Blockbuster company, which was one of the top companies renting movies in the US in 2004, it had about 10,000 stores, 5,000 of them only in the US, and revenue in billions. This company was replaced by a startup called Netflix back in 2010. By 2010, Blockbuster had a big problem and after a couple of years, it no longer existed. This shows that competition isn't just affecting revenue; it can lead to the complete vanishing of a company.

**Technology is changing business** Therefore, technology is changing how we do business. It's changing how we deliver services and products to end-users. What is the value of Blockbuster's 10,000 stores in the US when [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) delivers movies using an app on the TV for everyone at home? Companies that don't understand the digital disruption happening will face the same fate. Current Fortune 500 companies will face the same challenge tomorrow if they don't understand digital disruption and how to use technology for innovation. Business and technical innovation is not optional anymore; it's the only way to survive. It is not just about reducing revenue; it can lead to a company being completely out of the market.

**Productivity and reliability** Since we understand the importance of innovation, we need to understand that innovation needs to be delivered quickly and reliably to the end-user. It's very important to give the end-user value quickly and ensure it is reliable. If I deliver quickly without reliability, I lose the brand, customers, and much more. Because we live in a technology-driven world, developers are at the heart of company innovations. It's very important to provide developers with tools that increase their productivity and accelerate cooperation, helping to bring more innovation and deliver value quickly with high reliability.

### **DevOps**

If we ask what DevOps is, we will probably get different answers or definitions. For some, it's all about collaboration between development and operations; for others, it's infrastructure as code, automation, cultural change, small or frequent deployments, Kanban for operations, or a job title. What is DevOps? DevOps is none of the above. Of course, all of that is part of DevOps, but DevOps is broader. It is all about the union or integration between people, processes, and products to deliver continuous value to the end-user. It looks at a complete end-to-end process for software development and delivery, aiming to deliver quick value with high reliability.

**DevOps statistics based on 27,000 companies** A study analyzed DevOps adoption and practices in around twenty-seven to thirty thousand companies, conducted by two organizations: DORA ([DevOps Research and Assessment](https://cloud.google.com/devops/)) and Puppet, a software company providing configuration management tools. One important metric from the study is the frequency of deployment in production.

**Frequency of deployment in production increases every year** The study found that the frequency of deployment has increased over the years, with a 17% increase from 2014 to 2015, 40% in 2016, and around 60% in 2017. More companies are moving towards more frequent deployments in production. The study found that companies at the top deploy 200 times more frequently than those at the bottom. For example, if a top company deploys to production every day, a bottom company will deploy every 200 days. Also, top companies have a 2,555 times faster lead time compared to bottom companies. The lead time is the duration between starting work on a requirement and deploying it to production. Companies implementing high-performance DevOps exceed their profit, market share, and productivity goals by over two times. They rarely fail, and if they do, they recover super fast, with top companies recovering 2,600 times faster than those at the bottom. This understanding helps in getting a DevOps tutorial for beginners.

Top companies embrace failure, learn, and adapt quickly. They have thousands of lessons learned, making them resilient. When they fail, they recover super fast. Companies at the bottom keep fighting to prevent failure, relying on extensive documentation and processes, making recovery slower. Top companies measure failure rates, mean time to detect, and mean time to recover, constantly improving. Some companies, like Netflix, have created frameworks like chaos monkey to intentionally fail their systems and learn from it.

**Is there any real story?** Amazon deploys to production every 11.6 seconds, with a maximum of 10,000 deployments in a single hour. There are great sessions by Amazon explaining their journey to continuous delivery, along with examples from companies like Netflix, Esty, HubSpot, and others.
