I am extremely honored to receive such an important award for 5th year
in a row. To be considered as Microsoft\'s MVP for Visual Studio ALM
award is really a great honor and a privilege. I am honestly grateful
for the recognition I have received for my work in past year and to be
part of such a great community. On my way, I\'ve faced several
challenges. But each one of them has only strengthened me to make me the
person I am today. A person who knows exactly what he wants. For
achieving this award I\'ve had many inspirations from the community.++
Friends and senior colleagues. For whom I have the deepest respect . And
who gave me the extra strength to challenge myself and perform better at
each stage. My promise to myself and to the community, is to only get
better at my work so that I will be able to share more such awards here.
Thank you!
