In this **5** minutes video, I introduced
[TFSEG](https://sites.google.com/site/tfsegyptusergroup/ "Team Foundation Server User Group")
Values and Principles, I believe these principles will help many people
and it may change their life if they are believers, it will also put the
roadmap for our contributors that want to join the user group and tell
them what we believe, to summarize the video, it will show the value of
automation, teamwork, code guidance, rules, unit testing, etc and how
all these fit with
[Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/ "Manifesto for Agile Software Development")
and TFS [Team Foundation
Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fda2bad5%28v=vs.110%29 "Application Lifecycle Management with Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server").

Each principle may need a whole day from me to represent but the presentation only about 5 minutes,
because it just introduce these principles, so if anyone has a question
or inquiry please don\'t hesitate to contact me, I may create
a details video later based on the community demand and questions.
Waiting for your feedback and questions For the prize of the video just
see this
