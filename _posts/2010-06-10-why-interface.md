Using interfaces adds flexibility and power to your design. It solves the hard equation of how to make classes cohesive and loosely coupled. By creating interfaces, classes donâ€™t need to know each other anymore. Interfaces define the services that will be provided by the class.

This applies the Dependency Inversion Principle.
