I decide to monthly collect every webcast, news, session, etc. of the
TFSEG (TFS Egypt User Group) and make one post about it, instead of
writing post for every event, so I delete all the old posts and collect
them in this post, and I will update this post for May 2012 and create a
new post from June 2012.
