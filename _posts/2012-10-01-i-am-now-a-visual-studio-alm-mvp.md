If you really
fall in love with someone I think the best thing ever on the earth is
that this person loves you too, this is the Visual Studio ALM MVP for
me, it\'s simply that Visual Studio ALM loves me too\.... Today I just
received an e-mail told me that Visual Studio really loves me too..here
is the content..

family that stand beside me, support and understand my passion, thanks
for friends for being there and encourage me all the time and even
