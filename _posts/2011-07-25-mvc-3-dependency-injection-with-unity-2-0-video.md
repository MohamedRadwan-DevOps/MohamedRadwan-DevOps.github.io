title: "MVC 3 Dependency injection with Unity 2.0 Video"

I just created a video that explains the new feature of MVC3 `IDependencyResolver`, which makes Dependency Injection (DI) easier with MVC .NET. I used the Unity 2.0 DI framework to inject Service A and Service B. In this video, I show how to work with Unity in design-time and run-time for different services. I will use Unity with Microsoft .NET MVC. As we know, Microsoft Unity is one of the application blocks for dependency injection in .NET.
