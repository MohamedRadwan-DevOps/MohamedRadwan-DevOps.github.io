[The Team Foundation Service become open for all Public)](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2012/06/11/team-foundation-service-preview-is-public.aspx?ocid=soc-n-eg-elite--MRadwan "TFS Service is Public")

I just saw that there is asking
about invitation code for [TFS Service](http://tfspreview.com/ "TFS Service") or as w called [Team Foundation Service](http://tfspreview.com/ "Team Foundation Service")

Preview (TFS Preview), so I just have 4 invitation so I just thought it
will be helpful to share them with all community so the first 4 users
will be able to use this invitation code. I hope you enjoy it, it\'s
really awesome! :-) Invitation code
`e131c-7eb9-4347-96eb-fc32ef6960e7`

It finished after about 5 hours Wow!,
the community really need it, I hope that everyone use
the invitation code to share his invitation with the community too.
