## 1. Introduction

This lab series will show you how to use Visual Studio and [TFS 11 Beta](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io/category/tfs-11-beta/ "TFS 11 Beta")  in various software activities such as development, build, test, deployment, project management, etc. The initial labs of this series were introduced by [Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/?ocid=soc-n-eg-elite--MRadwan "Brian Keller")  for Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 11 Beta. However, I decided to migrate the virtual machine's TFS 2010 collection to the new virtual machine that uses TFS 11 Beta, so I can perform the old and new labs using Visual Studio and TFS 11 Beta. To complete all labs that depend on the Tailspin project, you have to perform the migration. See the following post: [Migrate TFS 2010 Collection to TFS 11 Beta](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io/posts/migrate-and-upgrade-tfs-collection-from-tfs-2010-to-tfs-11-beta-video/)
