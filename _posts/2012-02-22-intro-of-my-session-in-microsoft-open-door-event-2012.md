These are some snapshots from my session in Microsoft Open Door Event
2012. It\'s the first time on the stage, in spite of I give many
consultation and session in Egypt, KSA, Kuwait and Libya but actually
standing on the stage is really different!!! , it was really good
experiences to doing this :-) 

Again thanks Hosam and Ayman for this trust, I want also to thank Ahmed Nasr, my partner on the stage and the
session, it\'s really good to have someone like Ahmed in the session
because when you feel that there is another one very professional with
you like Nasr you will feel very confidant, so really thanks Nasr for
your support and help :-)
