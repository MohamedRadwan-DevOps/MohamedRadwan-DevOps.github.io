I am pleased to announce that my new Testing and Configuration Framework (**TestingConf Utilities**) is now published on CodePlex. You can find it here: [http://testingconfutilities.codeplex.com/](http://testingconfutilities.codeplex.com/ "TestingConf Utilities")

This framework is a very lightweight tool that will help any developer like **me** who really believes in and practices **TDD (Test Driven Development), BDD (Behavior Driven Development), and Unit Testing**. It contains many methods to aid in testing, configuration, and automation.

For instance, suppose you need to check if the insert method succeeded or not. You will need to verify the value in the database. There is a method in this framework where you provide the DB connection string, table name, and column name, and it retrieves the value directly so you can assert whether it matches the expected value.

Explore the framework and see how it can enhance your development and testing processes.
