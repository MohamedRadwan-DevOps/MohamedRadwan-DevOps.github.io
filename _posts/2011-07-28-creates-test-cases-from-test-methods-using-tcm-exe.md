Tcm.exe is an application that can be used to creates test cases from
test methods, we can also run test cases with associated automation test
 instead of using the user interface so it can be run with the nightly
build batch When you start the run from the command line, use tcm.exe.
You must specify both the test settings that contain the set of roles
that you require to run your tests, and an environment that contains
this set of roles. So Tcm.exe is a command-line utility that lets you
perform the following tasks:

-   Import automated tests into a test plan
-   Run tests that are part of a test plan from the command line
-   View a list of test items and their corresponding IDs to use when
    you import tests or run testsfor more information see the
