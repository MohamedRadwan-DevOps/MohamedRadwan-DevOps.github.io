In this series I will start introducing what's new in Visual Studio 11
and Team Foundation Server 11 (TFS 11) or as we expect to be [Visual Studio 2012](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us "Visual Studio 2012") and [Team

## Introduction

I performed the [Team Foundation
Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fda2bad5%28v=vs.110%29 "Application Lifecycle Management with Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server")
(TFS) 11 Beta upgrade from the day one of the Beta release, I read many
blog articles,
[MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms123401 "MSDN"),
I also saw many videos, so I will not re-invent the wheel by
rewriting what I have read or viewed throughout all the previous period,
but I will put the main points of the new features or improvements and I
will put my feedback and realization about these features.

### So the first question: why did we upgrade, especially since the RTM is not released yet?

![](https://public.sn2.livefilestore.com/y1pIqQX6wEQQ0BAV9nEBJ591WhoVKuFS26hbW0VxgoSe3Hn-3WdrHrvkKqq1I0w9zM0n6PRHiAvGmMIugkA4f_YmA/Why%20Upgrade%20to%20new%20TFS.JPG?psid=1 "Why Upgrade to new TFS")

This is always one of my main questions all the
time for any new technology or framework. Unfortunately, my answer was
far from what I believe now. I used to trust my
experience and my existing solution, but what did I find? I found that all my solutions were
outdated and there were elegant solutions available, perfect, fast, easy and
I just missed all of them all the time. Eventually, I realized the truth!
The world keeps changing and there are always improvements and **your
perfect solution today will be the worst tomorrow :-(** New
technologies mean new features and enhancements for the old, some people
said and new bugs too! especially in the beta, absolutely right, but
it's always **what you get more and more bigger than what you
face** of issues or bugs and you know that if you really master your
tools. It's a long story to tell so enough talk and let's see what I
decided.

### So this is what I believe now!

This is why the upgrade is a must for me and I
always wait for it and **guess what? it has more than I expected**
:-)
