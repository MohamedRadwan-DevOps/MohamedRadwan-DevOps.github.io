One of my favorite movie scenes is from [Man on Fire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328107/ "Man on Fire"), actually [Denzel Washington](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000243/ "Denzel Washington") is one of my favorite actors too.

**Bad Cop:**   I'm really sorry for the girl. It was just business, you know? I'm a professional. 
             
**Denzel:**    That's what everyone keeps saying. I'm Just Professional. Everybody keeps saying that to me. I'm Just Professional. I'm Just Professional. **I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it. Do you understand me?**
             

This is exactly what is happened to me. Everyone I meet keeps saying:
I am just Agile I am just Agile I am just Agile I am just Agile - **I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it. Do you understand me?** 

The story began when I started working as a Senior Developer and Team Leader. Every company I worked for said they were working with [**Agile**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development "Agile software development") and especially [**Scrum**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)) and they have a **Stand-up meeting**, **Iteration delivery**, and many other terms and practices. 

[WOW they are really [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development "Agile software development") !!]

In the first company that claimed to be working with [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) I didn't know [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) well, so I believed the company and was very excited to learn how the real [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) works. After a while, and after I started reading about [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) I realized the truth: they don't even know what [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) is at all and they **Don't Want to.**

I tried to tell them about [**Unit Testing**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing "Unit Testing"), [**TDD** (Test Driven Development)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development "Test driven development") or even [**Build Automation**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation "Build automation"), or even well-defined [**Product Backlog**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)#Product_Backlog "Product Backlog") or **[Burn-Down Chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn-down_chart)** but they didn't agree and considered all these as optional. **Their answer and explanation are very simple...**

## 

## [We are customizing the [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) stupid!!!!!]

## [What kind of customization are you doing????? ]

## [Poor M.Radwan he is not flexible at all !!!!]

So now we don't work with traditional style or even [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) because we don't have well-defined requirements or processes and we don't apply the main basics of [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) that help us work as [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

I started contacting friends in other companies and told them about my story and it was a **big surprise for me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

## 

## [They are the same !!!!!!!!!!]

The problem is that now we have this knowledge, so people there talk to each other and they start **believing their lies.** Developers move from company to company to find the new company working with the same style of [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), so our conceptual idea of [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) is **corrupted and spread to many companies (95%)**. The rest (**5%**) I didn't see them but I guess they maybe there. Whenever I explain the idea to them, they consider my idea to be the perfect world and ideal and not be applicable at all, and **I am just another freak !!!!**

This is why I chose the topic of my Thesis for my M.Sc. to be **How To Transition To [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)** and how to help companies and people implement the **best practices** of **[Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)** and of course TFS and [VS ALM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tfs/fda2bad5.aspx "Visual Studio Application Lifecycle Management") as my tools for properly applying Agile Development.
