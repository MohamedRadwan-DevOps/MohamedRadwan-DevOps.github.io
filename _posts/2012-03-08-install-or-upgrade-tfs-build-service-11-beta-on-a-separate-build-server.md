In this video I will show you how to upgrade or install TFS build
service 11 beta on a separate build server, actually the build server
machine is already has TFS build service 2010. TFS 2010 build service
can coexist with TFS 11 beta build service and everyone will support
it\'s TFSx server. If we building Windows 8 Project, the build server
must be on Windows 8 machine, this is for now and for the beta, in
Microsoft, they didn\'t know if this could change or not.
