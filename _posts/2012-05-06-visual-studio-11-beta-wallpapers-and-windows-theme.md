**Note:** I create new Wallpapers and themes, you can find
them [here](https://mohamedradwan.com/2012/05/19/visual-studio-11-beta-wallpapers-and-windows-theme-v-2-0/)
I search for Visual Studio 11 or Visual Studio 2011 wallpaper or theme
but I couldn\'t find any, so I decide to create some and share them with
the community. Here, you can find a windows theme, it has 5 wallpapers
and the next image change every 10 seconds.
