From little while I talked about how [Visual Studio 2012](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us "Visual Studio 2012 RC")
come with different strategy and now we have
[TFS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fda2bad5%28v=vs.110%29 "ALM and TFS") 
[Team Foundation Server Express](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chaks/archive/2012/03/05/getting-started-with-tfs-11-express-beta.aspx?ocid=soc-n-eg-elite--MRadwan "Team Foundation Server Express ")
and how it goinong to be really helpful as a free program for small
teams. After the [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fda2bad5%28v=vs.110%29 "Application Lifecycle Management with Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server")
Express 2012 RC lunch, I just want to try it and share this with the
community as I always do, so in this video I will install TFS (Team
Foundation Server Express 2012 RC ) on [Windows 8 Release Preview](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview "Windows 8 Release Preview"),
I will also install TFS Build Service 2012 RC on the same machine
(Windows 8 Release Preview) and finally I will install Team Explorer
2012 RC and [create a new team project](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2011/12/07/team-foundation-service-preview-create-team-project.aspx?ocid=soc-n-eg-elite--MRadwan "Create a team project")
so we can examine [Team Web Access](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee523998(v=vs.110).aspx "Working within Team Web Access") and
how to see that it doesn\'t support
[Backlog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jasonz/archive/2012/05/29/my-favorite-features-managing-projects-with-the-backlog-sprint-planning-and-taskboard-features-in-team-foundation-server-11.aspx?ocid=soc-n-eg-elite--MRadwan "Backlog with TFS")
and Board feature, and of-course no SharePoint. See the video here
