I know I am late to write about it, but the reason that drive me to
write about it, I just forget it :-( Really it\'s very important update
for Visual Studio and TFS 2010, so this update will do the following:

-   Allow Visual Studio 2010 to work with a TFS 11 server - including
    [Team Foundation Service Preview](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2011/09/14/team-foundation-server-on-windows-azure.aspx?ocid=soc-n-eg-elite--MRadwan "Team Foundation Server on Windows Azure: A Preview is available!")
-   Support for multi-line test steps in Microsoft Test Manager
-   Team Explorer Crashes when opening build from TFS 2008
-   Gated Checkins fail with the \"Preserve local Changes\" option
-   DiffMerge closes with unhandled exception when comparing two files
