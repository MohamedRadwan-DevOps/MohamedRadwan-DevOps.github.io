I published a quick guide about DevOps. This guide will help you to understand the fundamentals of DevOps, which groups different older and newer concepts into a movement aiming to have strong automation of all development steps and to deliver high-quality products in shorter development cycles.

>If you want to know more about maintaining the backlog in a proper way, you can visit the following post: [Key Tips For Maintaining Good Product Backlog in Agile and Scrum](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io/posts/key-tips-for-maintaining-good-product-backlog-in-agile-and-scrum/). The post describes a way to efficiently organize the [backlog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/work/backlogs/create-your-backlog) items, allowing you to understand the requirements better and providing you with a higher level of detail of what is actually expected from the work or delivery perspective.
