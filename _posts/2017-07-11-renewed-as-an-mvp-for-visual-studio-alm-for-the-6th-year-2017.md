It was a great pleasure to receive Microsoft\'s email announcing, that I\'ve been renewed as **MVP for Visual Studio ALM** for a **sixth consecutive year**! Once again it is a large honor to receive such important award and I am grateful for this high recognition. I have to say that, the journey to this **6th MVP award** in a row, was not easy, but I enjoyed every step of it. I did not make the journey here alone, many people have supported me along the way, each in a different way and I would like to send special thanks to:

- **Hande Kayadeniz Torkan**, who has been always a great MVP Lead;
- **Lina Magdy** who has been very helpful;
- **Dr. Ahmed Bahaa**, my mentor, friend, and confidant;
- Special thanks to my family, friends, and colleagues;
- Last, but not least, thanks to **Microsoft** and **Visual Studio team** for this amazing journey!

Congrats also to all other MVP\'s that got the reward in July!
