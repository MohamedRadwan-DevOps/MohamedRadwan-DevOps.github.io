What is the workflow integration and testing capabilities?  This is what
**Build Agent**, **Lab Agent** and **Test Agent** will provide

## **The workflow integration:**

It refer to the capabilities of the Lab Management to deploy existing

deploy it (so Build Agent on virtual environment only deploy the build
on the build server not really build it)

## **The testing capabilities:**

It refer to the capabilities of the Lab Management to run tests on that
