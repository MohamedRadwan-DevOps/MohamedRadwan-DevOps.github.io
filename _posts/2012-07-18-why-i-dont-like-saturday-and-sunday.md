When you start looking to my [blog](https://mohamedradwan-devops.github.io "Mohamed Radwan")
status on [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com "Wordpress website"),
you will realize the truth which is why I don\'t like Saturday and
Sunday at all, in a simple word, it is the community vacation, of course
it\'s not only in on my blog, it\'s everywhere in [MSDN
forum](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/categories "MSDN Forum"),
[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/ "stackoverflow"),
emails, I can feel that with the number of asked questions and the
number of answers. I feel like the community is shutting down during
these days and it coming back after them, this also reflect very
important points, that people outside,  most of my visitors, respect
weekend so much as they respect their work, **work hard** and **play
hard**. But unfortunately here we don\'t **work hard** or even **play
hard** but we **sleep hard**!!! this our probelm that we try to change
in our community and I believe we will make a huge different but without
the real community follow and feedback we talk to ourselves. So the day
that **Saturday **and **Sunday** grown up and become longer than the
others, the day that I Know our local
and regional community is coming up. We are rally working for the **Rise
of Local and Regional Community   ** Join us to sucess together [MEA
