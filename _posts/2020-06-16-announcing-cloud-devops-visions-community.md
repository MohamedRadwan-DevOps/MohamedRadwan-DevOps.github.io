# Cloud DevOps Visions

I am delighted to announce the new community **Cloud DevOps Visions.**  
[**Cloud DevOps Visions**](https://github.com/CloudDevOpsVisions) is an open-source initiative that believes in open-source education. It aims to help and educate people all over the world to learn DevOps and Cloud. It will teach and help people to implement the best practices through different activities targeting a variety of tools, technologies, and platforms. DevOps is one of the most emerging topics of software development today as it improves the whole software development process. Still, unfortunately, there is no clear, detailed, and explicit model to teach the best Modern Engineering practices on real-world projects; this was the main problem that leads to Cloud DevOps Visions community establishment.

## Cloud DevOps Visions provides several activities

Also, open-source projects and many others (e.g., people can work on the DevOps open-source projects and studying group because it a place to show yourself, your skills, commitment, and passion to all the communities).

**Cloud DevOps Visions** aims to build more community champions that can help others and more people. You need to think of the community as follows: it is just as a platform where you only contribute to this platform, and by doing so, you get recognized by people that they can trust in you, in what you are doing, and in your skills and commitment. Another point, the community has more opportunities for professional networks like:

- 1st source for hiring skilled people
